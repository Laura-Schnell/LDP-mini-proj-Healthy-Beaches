**Description of the data:**

Data was collected from the Healthy Beaches program results archive hosted by the Saskatchewan government. Data is reported in pdf format and I copied the data into comma separated format while preserving the format and organization. 

**Variable descriptions:**

* E. coli levels were recorded in colony forming units (CFU) per 100 mL of water. Water was cultured by the Roy Romanow Provincial Lab. E. coli is abbreviated to ec. 
* Microcystin levels are measured as micrograms per litre and was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) performed by the Roy Romanow Provincial Lab. Microcystin is abbreviated to mc.
