**Data collection** 

This data was taken from the Saskatchewan website Healthy Beaches sampling results archive page here: https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/categories/4324. Data formats were originally in .pdf and were copied to text and then .csv in the same format as that in the pdf by Laura Schnell. The Healthy Beaches data was taken from water collects performed across Saskatchewan. E. coli and microcystin was measured by the Roy Romanow Provincial Lab. 

**Healthy Beaches Program**

The Healthy Beaches Program has been running for 12 years, according to the Frequently Asked Questions document on the Saskatchewan Government webpage about the project (found here: https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/products/101640). The data available on the public archive is from 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023. Data from 2021 is listed but has a broken link and thus was unable to be collected. Observations are done periodically throughout with sampling frequency determined by volunteer capacity, weather, and beach popularity. Water collection was done at beaches across Saskatchewan with a focus on more-populated areas or areas with reported blue-green algae blooms. Water collection is taken by Healthy Beaches employees and volunteers. E. coli and microcystin amounts were measured by the Roy Romanow Provincial Lab.
