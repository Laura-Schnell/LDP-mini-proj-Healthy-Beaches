This data was taken from the Saskatchewan website Healthy Beaches sampling results archive page here: https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/categories/4324
Data formats were originally in .pdf and were copied to text and then .csv in the same format as that in the pdf. The program has changed data presentations over the years. I did my best to normalize them without changing the data.

The Healthy Beaches data was taken from water collects performed across Saskatchewan. E. coli and microcystin was measured by the Roy Romanow Provincial Lab.
