# Abstract

1.  Beaches provide important ecosystem and recreational services but we don't want to get sick or die when we swim in them - that would suck.

2.  Luckily, the Healthy Beaches Program run by the Saskatchewan Health Department measures *E. coli*, a potentially pathogenic bacteria, and microcystin, a liver toxin, levels at popular recreational areas around the province. I have downloaded the data from 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023 to perform exploratory visualization.

3.  Very unsophisticatedly managed to view the *E. coli* level at Last Mountain Lake popular beaches. This showed that often, *E. coli* increased in water during August.

4.  This exploration has given me a lot of ideas of future things that one could look at. For example, is this due to human inputs and only occurs in the popular beaches? The unpopular beaches are sampled less, so how can we know?

    **Key-words**: beaches, E. coli, microcystin

# Introduction

## Here is the background info about the thing...

People go into water at beaches and therefore interact with things in the water. Blue-green algae can produce microcystin which is a liver toxin able to cause death in low doses [@zhou2021]. Exposure to E. coli in recreational waters can cause health issues and is therefore regualrly monitored in many places [@weiskerger2020]. In Saskatchewan, this is done by the Healthy Beaches program [@healthy].

# Methods

To perform exploratory data analysis, I collected archived beach sampling data from 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023. Original copies of data in pdf format can be found here: <https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/categories/4324>.

Data was converted to csv format and the data of all four years was collected in the same document.

Data was cleaned by removing white spaces before and after input values and converting datatypes as many were imported incorrectly. Additional columns were added for year, month, and day data to be held separately as well as a month-day column for easier data visualization.

Data was subset to just look at *E. coli* amounts at popular sampling sites on Last Mountain Lake. To visualize the data, ggplot2 was used.

```{r results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
# this code chunk is for the grateful package. It prints out a text summary of all of the packages you have used in your project. Again you cn either list the ones you want to include or "omit" ones you want to exclude
cite_packages(output = "paragraph", out.dir = "../04-manuscript/", omit = c("knitr", "tinytex"))
```

All code along with the simulation algorithms used are available on GitHub here: <https://github.com/Laura-Schnell/ARCHIVE-mini-proj-Healthy-Beaches>

# Results

*E. coli* levels fluctuate over the course of the summer \ref{fig:lml_sub_ec_by_year.png}. Some recreational areas fluctuate more than others. In most cases, *E. coli* rises in August if it raises at all. This is the most seen with the more sampled beaches \ref{fig:RB_RRP_ec_by_yr.png}. 

# Discussion

Potential reasons for the \*E. coli\* fluctuations over the course of the summer. Ideas for future sampling that could illuminate this trend/allow us to look for relationships.

# Tables

**Table 1.** Mean body mass of penguins on different islands over time.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
penguin_sum <- penguins %>%
  group_by(island, year) %>%
  summarize(mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r table_01, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}
# kable(x = penguin_sum, 
#       col.names = c("Island", "Year", "Mean Body Mass (g)")) %>%
#   kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position") 

# without the "hold_position" the table ends up at the top of the page
# Also, to get this to work in MS Word we need to delete this whole code chunk.
# I will show you why.
```

## Alternate 'flextable' version that works if your output is to MS Word

Note: for the Word version the `kable` does not output correctly. In fact it throws an error ðŸ™„. You could try using the `flextable` package instead: <https://taehoonh.me/content/post/alternative-to-kable-function-when-knitting-to-ms-word.html>

```{r table_01_b, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}

penguin_sum %>% 
  regulartable()
```

**Figure 2**. *E. coli* at the two most sampled beaches at Last Mountain Lake.

# Figures

Figures inserted using the basic URL style: 
### First the basic URL style insert:

![Figure 1 caption text: - *E. coli* at beaches at Last Mountain Lake that have been sampled at least 5 times over four years..](..\03_figures\lml_sub_ec_by_year.png)

\newpage

![Figure 2 caption text: - *E. coli* at the two most sampled beaches at Last Mountain Lake...](..\03_figures\RB_RRP_ec_by_yr.png)

<!-- You CAN include a caption in the code chunk header (fig.cap) but I have to say that getting the numbering and formatting all sorted out is not easy. Sometimes it works (auto-numbering) and sometimes it doesn't. I think it is easier to use text as demonstrated above under Figure Captions but I include it here for completeness. I think the Bookdown package (versus RMarkdown) is more sophisticated when it comes to auto-numbering figures etc. -->

# Appendices

```{=html}
<!-- You might want to look into Bookdown if you want to do anything fancier
with your manuscript. Bookdown allows for automatic Table and Figure numbering
as well as cross referencing. That is you can create links between 'Fig 1' in
your manuscript that links to the actual figure and automatically increment the
the figure numbers as you add or remove them from the document.

I add this here because Appendices can require special handling by some 
journals and Bookdown might allow you to do that automagically -->
