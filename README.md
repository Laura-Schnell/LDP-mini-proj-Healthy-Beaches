Beaches provide important ecosystem and recreational services. The presence of harmful bacteria or toxins in beach water can pose a threat to both humans and wildlife.
The Saskatchewan Department of Health surveys beach water regularly each summer and records information on E. coli (potentially pathogenic bacteria) and microcystin 
(a hepatotoxin) levels in water samples. In this project, I aim to compare this data over time in popular lakes. 

The data folder has raw and clean data. 
The scripts folder contains associated R project. 

The file naming convention within this directory uses the project title in long or short-form with descriptive keywords at the end.
