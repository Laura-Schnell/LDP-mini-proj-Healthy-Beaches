Beaches provide important ecosystem and recreational services. The presence of harmful bacteria or toxins in beach water can pose a threat to both humans and wildlife. The Saskatchewan Department of Health surveys beach water regularly each summer and records information on *E. coli* (potentially pathogenic bacteria) and microcystin (a hepatotoxin) levels in water samples. In this project, I aim to compare the amount of *E. coli* at specific recreational areas over time. This project is part of the requirements for the Living Data Project Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution taken in Fall semester of 2023. 

**File structure:**
* *Folder 00_raw_data* contains the data collected from the Healthy Beaches program data archive hosted by the Government of Saskatchewan and found here: https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/categories/4324. This data was transferred from .pdf format to .csv by Laura Schnell. 

* *Folder 01_R_scripts* contains the R project made for this, the renv folder with package information, and the data wrangling script. 

* *Folder 02_clean_data* houses the data output from the data wrangling script.

* *Folder 03_figures* hosts the figures generated by the data wrangling R script.
